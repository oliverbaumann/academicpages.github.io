I am a Professor with special responsibilities at the [University of Southern Denmark (SDU)](http://sdu.dk), where I am a part of the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) unit.

My research deals with questions of organizational search, learning, and adaptation. In particular, I study how firms can be designed to search effectively for solutions to complex problems, and to learn and adapt effectively in uncertain and dynamic environments. Conceptualizing organizations as complex adaptive systems, I mainly develop theory through computational models that borrow from techniques in reinforcement learning. My research has been published or is forthcoming in Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Management, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal, among others.

I received a PhD in Business Economics from LMU Munich, an MS in Industrial Engineering from the University of Karlsruhe, and an MS in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining the University of Southern Denmark, I was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich.
