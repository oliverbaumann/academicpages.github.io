I am a Professor with special responsibilities at the University of Southern Denmark, where I am a part of the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) unit.

I study how organizations can be designed to deal effectively with complex and changing environments. My work has appeared in Organization Science and the Strategic Management Journal, among others. Theoretically, I conceive of **innovation as search and learning processes** by agents that possess only bounded rationality. In doing so, my work builds on accounts of organizational problem solving and decision making in the tradition of the behavioral theory of the firm and evolutionary economics. Methodologically, I mainly develop formal theory through **computational models of firms as complex adaptive systems**.

I received a Ph.D. in Business Economics from LMU Munich, a Diplom-Wirtschaftsingenieur (M.Sc. in Business Engineering) from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and an M.S. in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining the University of Southern Denmark, I was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich.
