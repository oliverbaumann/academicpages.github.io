I am an industrial engineer (with a focus on applied computer science and operations research) turned organizational scholar. I am fascinated by the notion of social organizations as complex adaptive systems and by the power of computational approaches for understanding their dynamics. My research focuses on questions of organizational design, learning, and adaptation. In particular, I have addressed two broad questions: (1) How does organizational design affect a firm’s ability to deal with complex decision problems? (2) How does organizational design affect a firm’s ability to adapt to dynamic environments? My work is mainly theoretical but seeks to build bridges to various application domains such as corporate strategy or new product development. In addressing these questions, I work primarily with computational models, but have also engaged in in-depth field studies of individual firms as well as conceptual projects. Supported by a grant from the Independent Research Fund Denmark (2017-2021), I am currently migrating several computational models of multi-actor organizations into web-based experimental platforms, using them to conduct laboratory and online experiments. My research has been published in Administrative Science Quarterly, Advances in Strategic Management, Journal of Management, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal, among others.

I received a PhD in Business Economics from LMU Munich, an MS in Industrial Engineering from the University of Karlsruhe, and an MS in Engineering Management from Portland State University. I am a Professor with special responsibilities at the [University of Southern Denmark (SDU)](http://sdu.dk), where I am a part of the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) unit. Prior to joining the University of Southern Denmark, I was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich.
