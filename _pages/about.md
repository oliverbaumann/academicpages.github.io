I am a Professor with special responsibilities at the [University of Southern Denmark (SDU)](http://sdu.dk), where I am a part of the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) unit.

My research interests center on the learning problems that organizations face as they interact with an uncertain and dynamic environment, and on how organizations can be designed to learn effectively. Conceptualizing organizations as complex adaptive systems, I mainly develop theory through computational models. My research has been published in Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Management, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal, among others.

I received a PhD in Business Economics from LMU Munich, an MS in Industrial Engineering from the University of Karlsruhe, and an MS in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining the University of Southern Denmark, I was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich.
