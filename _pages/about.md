I am a Professor with special responsibilities at the University of Southern Denmark, where I am a part of the [Strategic Organization Design]{http://www.sod-research.com} unit. I study how organizations can be designed to deal effectively with complex and changing environments. My work has appeared in Organization Science and the Strategic Management Journal, among others. I received a Ph.D. in Business Economics from LMU Munich, a Diplom-Wirtschaftsingenieur (M.Sc. in Business Engineering) from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and an M.S. in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining the University of Southern Denmark, I was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich.
