I am a Professor with special responsibilities at the University of Southern Denmark, where I am a part of the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) unit.

My research is at the intersection of *organization design, innovation, and strategy*. In particular, I study how organizations can be designed to deal effectively with complex and changing environments. I conceive of *innovation as a search and learning process* mainly develop formal theory through *computational models of firms as complex adaptive systems*.

I received a Ph.D. in Business Economics from LMU Munich, a Diplom-Wirtschaftsingenieur from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and an M.S. in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining the University of Southern Denmark, I was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich.
