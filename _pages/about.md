I am a Professor with special responsibilities at the [University of Southern Denmark (SDU)](http://sdu.dk), where I am a part of the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) unit.

My research deals with the implications of organization design for innovation and change. Specifically, I study how firms can be designed to search effectively for solutions to complex problems, and how they learn and adapt effectively in uncertain and dynamic environments. Conceptualizing organizations as complex adaptive systems, I mainly develop theory through computational models. My research has been published or is forthcoming in Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Management, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal, among others.

I received a PhD in Business Economics from LMU Munich, an MS in Industrial Engineering from the University of Karlsruhe, and an MS in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining the University of Southern Denmark, I was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich.
