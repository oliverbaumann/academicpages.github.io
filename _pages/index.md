I am a Professor with special responsibilities at the University of Southern Denmark, where I am a part of the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) unit.

My research is at the intersection of organization design, innovation, and strategy. In particular, I study how firms can be organized to deal effectively with complex and changing environments. Conceptualizing innovation as a search and learning process, I mainly develop formal theory through computational models of firms as complex adaptive systems.

I received a Ph.D. in Business Economics from LMU Munich, a Diplom-Wirtschaftsingenieur from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and an M.S. in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining the University of Southern Denmark, I was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich.
